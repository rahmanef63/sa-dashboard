# What's Wrong:
  - **Mixing Concerns:**
    - Login logic is intertwined with sidebar/menu services.
    - Authentication isn’t clearly separated from UI rendering.
  - **Ambiguous File Roles:**
    - *service.ts* under the sidebar folder suggests login is handled there, which can be confusing.
    - *admin-db.ts* looks out of place if it's used for login-related configurations.
  - **Missing Details:**
    - Lacks explicit error handling, session/token management, and security measures.
    - Doesn’t clearly show how state updates (like Redux slices) handle user data independently.

### Best Approach:
  - **Separate Authentication:**
    - Create a dedicated authentication module (e.g., `app/api/auth`) for login API calls.
    - Use separate Redux slices or contexts for user authentication and sidebar UI state.
  - **Clear File Organization:**
    - Keep API functions for login separate from menu/sidebar functions.
    - Rename and reorganize config files (e.g., move admin DB config to a more intuitive location).
  - **Improve State & Error Handling:**
    - Integrate proper error handling and secure token/session management.
    - Use middleware (like Redux-Thunk or Redux-Saga) to manage asynchronous login processes.
  - **Refine Custom Hooks:**
    - Let `useSidebar.ts` manage only sidebar state; don’t let it depend directly on login logic.
    - Use dedicated hooks for fetching or managing user authentication data if needed.

## Detailed Task Breakdown
1. Separate Authentication Concerns
- [ ] Create an Authentication Module
    - [ ] Establish a new folder (e.g. app/api/auth) for all authentication API functions.
    - [ ] Migrate login API calls from the sidebar-related service file to the new authentication module.
    - [ ] Implement dedicated functions for:
        - Initiating a login request.
        - Handling authentication responses.
        - Managing user sessions and tokens securely.
- [ ] Build Dedicated Redux Slice / Context for Authentication
    - [ ] Create a separate Redux slice (or context if using React Context) for authentication state.
    - [ ] Implement actions and reducers to handle:
        Authentication start/success/failure.
        Token handling (e.g., storage, refresh, and expiration).
- [ ] Implement Middleware for Asynchronous Login Management
- [ ] Refine Custom Hooks
    - [ ] Let `useSidebar.ts` manage only sidebar state; don’t let it depend directly on login logic.
    - [ ] Use dedicated hooks for fetching or managing user authentication data if needed.

2. Reorganize Code Structure
- [ ] Refactor Sidebar/ Menu Concerns
    - [ ] Review the useSidebar.ts hook and ensure it focuses solely on sidebar state management.
    - [ ] Remove any direct dependencies or logic related to authentication from sidebar services.
- [ ] Clarify File Roles and Locations
    - [ ] Review the current organization of files like service.ts (under the sidebar folder) and admin-db.ts.
    - [ ] Decide on improved locations for these files:
        Move authentication-related code from service.ts to the new authentication module.
        Relocate or rename admin-db.ts to a location more representative of its purpose (e.g., under a dedicated "configs" or "database" folder).
3. Enhance Error and State Handling
- [ ] Add Comprehensive Error Handling
    - [ ] Implement try-catch blocks and add logging for API calls.
    - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages and dispatch error states where needed.
- [ ] Improve Session and Token Management
    - [ ] Set up secure storage for tokens (consider HTTP-only cookies or secure storage depending on your front-end).
    - [ ] Establish clear token refresh and expiration processes within the new auth module.
4. Update Custom Hooks and UI Integration
- [ ] Refine useSidebar.ts
    - [ ] Strip out login-related logic so that the hook handles only UI state.
    - [ ] Add documentation/comments on the responsibilities of the sidebar hook.
- [ ] Create a Dedicated Authentication Hook
    - [ ] Develop a custom hook (e.g., useAuth.ts) that encapsulates authentication state and actions.
    - [ ] Leverage the dedicated Redux slice or context from step 1.2 for managing login state.
5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write Unit and Integration Tests
    - [ ] Develop tests for the new authentication module to ensure API calls, token handling, and error management work as expected.
    - [ ] Test the separate Redux slices/contexts for proper state updates.
    - [ ] Validate that the sidebar and authentication functions do not interfere with one another.
- [ ]  Conduct End-to-End Testing
    - [ ] Test the entire user login flow from UI input to API authentication.
    - [ ] Verify that error messages and session management follow best security practices.
6. Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update Documentation
    - [ ] Revise project documentation to reflect new file structure and module responsibilities.
    - [ ] Document how to use the new authentication API and custom hooks.
- [ ] Code Cleanup and Refactoring
    - [ ] Remove or archive any obsolete code that mixed authentication with sidebar logic.
    - [ ] Ensure all files follow your established coding standards and file naming conventions.
